This extension allows you to generate your Security Policy where you take an access control decision based on a set of parameters. Directives can be used to configure the engine itself, but also to send directives to the engine for access control. Directives look like the examples below:
SecDirective1 some options SecDirective2 &amp;quot;some option between brackets \&amp;quot; and escaped&amp;quot; SecSampleDirective this \ directive \ is splitted \ in lines Rule syntax # Rules are a special directive that must contain variables, operator and actions: SecRule VARIABLES &amp;quot;@OPERATOR OPERATOR_ARGUMENTS&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ACTIONS&amp;quot;.</description></item><item><title>Actions</title><link>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/actions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/actions/</guid><description>Each action belongs to one of five groups:
Disruptive actions - Cause Coraza to do something. In many cases something means block transaction, but not in all. For example, the allow action is classified as a disruptive action, but it does the opposite of blocking. There can only be one disruptive action per rule (if there are multiple disruptive actions present, or inherited, only the last one will take effect), or rule chain (in a chain, a disruptive action can only appear in the first rule).</description></item><item><title>Execution flow</title><link>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/execution-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/execution-flow/</guid><description>Phases # Phases are an abstract concept designed to fit most web servers execution flows and give it more oportunities to stop a request.
Phase 1: Request Headers # This phase will process rules with the following variables:
HTTP connection data, like IPs, ports and protocol version URI and GET arguments Request Headers: cookies, content-type and content-length Phase 2: Request Body # This phase will process rules with the following variables:</description></item><item><title>Operators</title><link>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/operators/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/operators/</guid><description>beginsWith # Description: Returns true if the parameter string is found at the beginning of the input.

SecRule ARGS &amp;quot;xp_cmdshell&amp;quot; &amp;quot;t:lowercase,id:91&amp;quot; Multiple transformation actions can be used in the same rule, forming a transformation pipeline. The transformations will be performed in the order in which they appear in the rule.
In most cases, the order in which transformations are performed is very important. In the following example, a series of transformation functions is performed to counter evasion.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/variables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://coraza.io/docs/seclang/variables/</guid><description>Variables are embedded in the core for performance reasons, which means they cannot be programmatically created. For that reason, there is a set of predefined variables that are available to plugin developers.
GRAPHQL JWT EXTRA ARGS # ARGS is a collection and can be used on its own (means all arguments including the POST Payload), with a static parameter (matches arguments with that name), or with a regular expression (matches all arguments with name that matches the regular expression).</description></item></channel></rss>
