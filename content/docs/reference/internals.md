## WAF Engine

Waf is the main interface used to store settings, rules and create transactions, most directives will set variables for Waf instances. A coraza implementation might have unlimited Waf instances and each Waf might process unlimited transactions.

## Transactions

Transactions are an instance of an url call for a Waf instance, transactions are created with ``wafinstance.NewTransaction()``. Transactions hold collections and configurations that may be updated using rules.

## Macro Expansion

Macro expansions are a function available for ``transactions``, a macro expansion will compile a string and provide variables data to the current context. Macro expansion is performed by running a regular expression that will find ``%{request_headers.test}`` and replace the value using:

```go
v1 := tx.GetCollection(variables.RequestHeaders).GetFirstString("test")
v2 := tx.MacroExpansion("%{request_headers.test}")
v1 == v2
// true
```

## Rules

Rules are triggered by ``RuleGroup.Evaluate(phase)`` based on the phase number, rules with phase 0 or ``rule.AlwaysMatch`` will always run. Rules that always run are SecMarkers or SecActions which means rules without operators.

Rules marked with a SecMarker will be used to control execution flow and tell the transaction to stop skipping rules from ``skipAfter``.

Different from ModSecurity, each rule is a unique struct in Coraza and is shared between each transaction of the same ``Waf`` instance, which means a transaction should never update any field from a Rule and all **variable** fields must be stored within the transaction instead.

Once a rule is triggered, it will follow the following flow:

1. Skip if this rule is removed for the current transaction
2. Fill the ``RULE`` variable data which contains fields from the current rule
3. Apply removed targets for this transaction
4. Compile each ``variable``, normal, counters, negations and "always match"
5. Apply transformations for each variable, match or multi-match
6. Execute the current operator for each variable
7. Continue if there was any match
8. Evaluate all non-disruptive actions
9. Evaluate chains recursively
10. Log data if requested
11. Evaluate ``disruptive`` and ``flow`` rules

The return of this function contains each ``MatchData``, which will tell the transaction where exactly the data was matched, **Variable, Key and Value**. Maybe we should add if it was negation in the future, SecActions and SecMarkers will return a placeholder.

**Important:** Rules may update a ``Transaction`` behaviour but not a ``Waf`` instance.

### Operators

Operators are stored in ``github.com/corazawaf/coraza/tree/v3/dev/internal/operators`` and contain an initializer and an evaluation function. Initializers are used to apply arguments during compilation, for example, ``"@rx /\d+/"`` will run ``op.Init("/\\d+")``. ``op.Evaluate(tx, "args")`` is applied for each compiled variable and will return if the condition matches. Operators uses ``Transaction`` to create logs, capture fields and access additional variables from the transaction.

**Note:** Operators must be concurrent-friendly

### Actions

Actions are stored in ``github.com/coraza-waf/coraza/v2/actions`` and contains an initializer and an evaluation function, the initializers are evaluated during compilation, for example, ``id:4`` will run ``act.Init("4")``. Depending on the ``Type()`` of each action, it will run on different phases.

* **Non-Disruptive:** Do something, but that something does not and cannot affect the rule processing flow. Setting a variable, or changing its value is an example of a non-disruptive action. Non-disruptive action can appear in any rule, including each rule belonging to a chain. **Non-disruptive rules are evaluated after the rule matches some data**.
* **Flow actions:** These actions affect the rule flow (for example skip or skipAfter). Flow actions are evaluated after the rule successfully matched and will only run for the parent rule of a chain.
* **Meta-data actions:** Meta-data actions are used to provide more information about rules. Examples include id, rev, severity and msg. Meta-data rules are only initialized, they won't be evaluated, ``act.Evaluate(...)`` will never be called.

### Transformations

Transformations are simple functions to transform some string into another string. There is a special struct called ``transactions.Tools``, that contains useful "tools" required for some transformations, which are ``UnicodeMapping`` for ``utf8ToUnicode`` and ``waf.Logger`` to debug transformations. More fields may be added in the future.

**Note:** Transformations are evaluated thousands of times per transaction and they must be SUPER FAST.

## Rule Groups

Rule Groups are like Modsecurity ``Rules``, it's just a container for rules that will return the list of rules concurrent-safe and will evaluate rules based on the requested phase.

## Collections

Collections are used by Coraza to store ``Variables``, all Variables are treated as the same type, even if they map values, they are single values or arrays.

Collections are stored as a slice ``[]*Collection``, each index is assigned based on it's constant name provided by ``variables.go``. For example, if you want to get a collection you might use ``tx.GetCollection(variables.Files)``. If you want to transform a named variable to it's constant you may use:

```go
b, _ := variables.ParseVariable("FILES")
tx.GetCollection(b)
```

In the following example we are showing the output for ``tx.GetCollection(variables.RequestHeaders).Data()``.

```json
{
    "user-agent": [
        "some user agent string"
    ]
}
```

Some helpers may be used for this cases, like ``tx.GetCollection(variables.RequestHeaders).GetFirstString("")``.

Variables are compiled in runtime in order to support Regex(precompiled) and XML, the function ``tx.GetField(variable)``. Using RuleVariable.Exceptions and []exceptions might seem redundant but both are different, the list of exception is complemented from the rule. In case of Regex, ``GetField`` will use ``RuleVariable.Regex`` to match data instead of ``RuleVariable.Key``.

**Note:** Collections are not concurrent-safe, don't share transactions between routines.

## Phases

Phases are used by ``RuleGroup`` to filter between execution phases on HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0.

**Phase 1: Request Headers**

This phase process theorically consists in three phases:

* Connection (```tx.ProcessConnection()```): Request address and port
* Request line (```tx.ProcessURI()```): Request URL, does not include GET arguments
* Request headers (```tx.ProcessRequestHeaders()```) Will evaluate phase 1

**Phase 2: Request Body**

This phase only runs when ```RequestBodyAcces``` is ```On```, otherwise we will skip to phase 3. This phase will do one of the following:

* Reject transaction if the request body is too long and ```RequestBodyLimitAction``` is set to ```Reject```
* If ```URLENCODED```: set POST arguments and request_Body
* If ```MULTIPART```: Parse files and set FILES variables
* If ```JSON```: Not implemented yet
* If none of the above was met and ```ForceRequestBodyVariable``` is set to true, URLENCODED will be forced

See **Body Handling** for more info.

**Phase 3: Response Headers**

**Phase 4: Response Body**

**Phase 5: Logging**

This is a special phase, it will always run but it must be handled by the client. For example, if there is any error reported by Coraza, the client must at least implement a ```defer tx.ProcessLogging()```. This phase will close handlers, save persistent collections and write audit loggers, in order to write the audit loggers the following conditions must be met:

* Transaction was marked with ```auditlog``` action
* There must be at least one audit logger (```SecAuditLog```)
* ```AuditEngine``` must be ```On``` or ```RelevantOnly```
* If ```AuditEngine``` was set to ```RelevantOnly``` the response status must match ```AuditLogRelevantStatus```

## Body handling

BodyBuffer is a struct that will manage the request or response buffer and store the data to temprary files if required. BodyBuffer will apply a few rules to decide whether to buffer the data in memory or write a temporary file, it will also return a ```Reader``` to the memory buffer or the temporary file created. Temporary files must be deleted by ```tx.ProccessLoging```.

## Persistent Collections

Not working yet.

## The ```tx.ProcessRequest(req)``` helper
