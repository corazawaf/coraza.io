Plugins are imported by calling the respective helpers:
- `plugins.RegisterOperator(...)`
- `plugins.RegisterAction(...)`
- `plugins.RegisterBodyProcessor(...)`
- `plugins.RegisterTransformation(...)`

Most plugins will register themselves automatically, but some will require you to call the respective helper.

Self-registering plugins will use init() to call the respective registration helper, and they can be imported like this:

```go
package main

include(
  "github.com/corazawaf/coraza/v3"
  _ "github.com/someorg/my-awesome-plugin
)
```
