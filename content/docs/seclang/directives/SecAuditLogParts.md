The format of the audit log format is documented in detail in the Audit Log Data Format Documentation.
Example:
```
SecAuditLogParts ABCFHZ
```

Available audit log parts:

A: Audit log header (mandatory).
B: Request headers.
C: Request body (present only if the request body exists and ModSecurity is configured to intercept it. This would require SecRequestBodyAccess to be set to on).
D: Reserved for intermediary response headers; not implemented yet.
E: Intermediary response body (present only if ModSecurity is configured to intercept response bodies, and if the audit log engine is configured to record it. Intercepting response bodies requires SecResponseBodyAccess to be enabled). Intermediary response body is the same as the actual response body unless ModSecurity intercepts the intermediary response body, in which case the actual response body will contain the error message (either the Apache default error message, or the ErrorDocument page).
F: Final response headers (excluding the Date and Server headers, which are always added by Apache in the late stage of content delivery).
G: Reserved for the actual response body; not implemented yet.
H: Audit log trailer.
I: This part is a replacement for part C. It will log the same data as C in all cases except when multipart/form-data encoding in used. In this case, it will log a fake application/x-www-form-urlencoded body that contains the information about parameters but not about the files. This is handy if you donâ€™t want to have (often large) files stored in your audit logs.
J: This part contains information about the files uploaded using multipart/form-data encoding.
K: This part contains a full list of every rule that matched (one per line) in the order they were matched. The rules are fully qualified and will thus show inherited actions and default operators. Supported as of v2.5.0.
Z: Final boundary, signifies the end of the entry (mandatory).
