Depending on the implementation, errors ranging from 1 to 2 might be directly
logged to the connector error log. For example, level 1 (error) logs will be
written to caddy server error logs.
The possible values for the debug log level are:

- 0:   No logging (least verbose)
- 1:   Error
- 2:   Warn
- 3:   Info
- 4-8: Debug
- 9:   Trace (most verbose)

Levels outside the 0-9 range will default to level 3 (Info)
