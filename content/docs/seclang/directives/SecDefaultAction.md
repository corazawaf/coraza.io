Every rule following a previous SecDefaultAction directive in the same configuration
context will inherit its settings unless more specific actions are used.

Rulesets like OWASP Core Ruleset uses this to define operation modes:

- You can set the default disruptive action to block for phases 1 and 2 and you can force
a phase 3 rule to be disrupted if the thread score is high.
- You can set the default disruptive action to deny and each risky rule will interrupt
the connection.

Important: Every SecDefaultAction directive must specify a disruptive action and a processing phase and cannot contain metadata actions.
